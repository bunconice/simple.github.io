        <h1>Thinking in React</h1>
        <p>
          React can change how you think about the designs you look at and the apps you build. When you build a user interface with React, you will first break it apart into pieces called components. Then, you will describe the different visual states for each of your components. Finally, you will connect your components together so that the data flows through them. In this tutorial, we‚Äôll guide you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table with React.
        </p>
        <h1>Break the UI into a component hierarchy</h1>
        <p>
          Start by drawing boxes around every component and subcomponent in the mockup and naming them. If you work with a designer, they may have already named these components in their design tool. Ask them! Depending
          on your background, you can think about splitting up a design into components in different ways.
        </p>
        <h1>Build a static version in React</h1>
        <p>
          Now that you have your component hierarchy, it‚Äôs time to implement your app. The most straightforward approach is to build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity‚Ä¶ yet! It‚Äôs often easier to build the static version first and add interactivity later. Building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, but adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.
